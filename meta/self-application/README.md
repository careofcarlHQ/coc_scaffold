# Self-Application Workspace

This directory tracks scaffold-on-itself execution in `coc_scaffold`.

## Active run

- Testing retrofit self-application:
  - [coverage-baseline.md](testing-retrofit/coverage-baseline.md)
  - [risk-priority-map.md](testing-retrofit/risk-priority-map.md)
  - [testing-checklist.md](testing-retrofit/testing-checklist.md)
  - [coverage-report.md](testing-retrofit/coverage-report.md)

## Intent

Keep process state durable across sessions so the framework can evolve through its own methodology instead of ad-hoc updates.

## Operating modes

- Solo + Copilot workflow:
  - [solo-copilot-process.md](solo-copilot-process.md)

## Gold standard program

- Scaffold-by-scaffold effectiveness and quality progression:
  - [gold-standard/README.md](gold-standard/README.md)
