# Run Summary — feature-addition / run-001

## Goal
Validate the feature-addition scaffold against a real feature delivered in the framework repo.

## Scenario
Feature: one-click solo merge automation for protected branch workflow.

## Outputs produced
- `impact-analysis.md`
- `feature-spec.md`
- `feature-checklist.md`
- `compatibility-check.md`
- `rollout-plan.md`

## Outcome
- Feature-addition workflow produced complete planning/execution artifacts.
- Safety and compatibility gates remained intact.
- Operational result matched intended feature behavior.

## Follow-up
- Execute a second run using a different feature type (non-automation, docs+template content delta) to confirm reproducibility.
