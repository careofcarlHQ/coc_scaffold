# Gold Standard Program

This workspace tracks how each scaffold moves from structurally valid to operationally proven ("gold standard").

## Purpose

The current test suite validates structure, links, templates, and process contracts.
Gold standard additionally requires evidence that each scaffold is effective in realistic execution.

## Program artifacts

- [framework-gold-standard.md](framework-gold-standard.md) — quality bar and scoring rules
- [scaffold-evaluation-matrix.md](scaffold-evaluation-matrix.md) — per-scaffold status and evidence index
- [templates/scaffold-effectiveness-review.md.template](templates/scaffold-effectiveness-review.md.template) — template for each scaffold review

## How to use

1. Pick one scaffold from the matrix
2. Run an effectiveness review using the template
3. Link artifacts and score each criterion
4. Update scaffold status in the matrix
5. Repeat until all scaffolds are marked `Gold`
