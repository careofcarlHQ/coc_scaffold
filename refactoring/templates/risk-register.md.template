## Common Refactoring Risks (pre-populated)

### RISK-T01: Characterization tests miss edge cases

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Category | Test coverage |
| Likelihood | Medium |
| Impact | High |

**Mitigation**: Test against production-like data. Compare I/O pairs before/after refactoring. Prioritize coverage on high-complexity functions.

### RISK-T02: Refactoring introduces subtle behavior change

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Category | Behavior change |
| Likelihood | Medium |
| Impact | High |

**Mitigation**: One pattern per PR. Full test suite after each change. Code review focused on behavioral equivalence.

### RISK-T03: Merge conflicts during refactoring

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Category | Team coordination |
| Likelihood | High |
| Impact | Medium |

**Mitigation**: Coordinate refactoring timing. Keep PRs small. Merge frequently. Work on isolated areas simultaneously rather than shared code.

### RISK-T04: Scope creep — discovering more to fix

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Category | Timeline |
| Likelihood | High |
| Impact | Medium |

**Mitigation**: Log discoveries in refactoring log. Don't act until planned. Re-assess priorities after each phase.

### RISK-T05: Loss of institutional knowledge during restructuring

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Category | Knowledge |
| Likelihood | Medium |
| Impact | Medium |

**Mitigation**: Document characterization notes. Preserve all comments and docstrings during moves. Update architecture docs after each target.
