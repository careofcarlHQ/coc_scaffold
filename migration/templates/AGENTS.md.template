# AGENTS.md — Migration: {Migration Name}

## What we're migrating
{From what state to what state — one sentence.}

## Current stage
Stage {N} — {stage name}

## Read these files (in order)
1. `AGENTS.md` (project-level rules)
2. `migration/current-state-snapshot.md` (where we started)
3. `migration/target-state-definition.md` (where we're going)
4. `migration/compatibility-gap-map.md` (what breaks)
5. `migration/migration-checklist.md` (all stages + current progress)
6. `migration/rollback-plan.md` (how to undo each stage)

## Non-negotiable constraints
- ALWAYS take a backup before any data-touching stage
- ALWAYS verify rollback works before marking a stage complete
- NEVER combine two migration stages into one operation
- NEVER delete old data/config/code until cleanup phase
- Run the full test suite after every stage
- If ANY verification fails, STOP and report — do NOT proceed

## Stage instructions
{Copy the specific stage instructions from the migration checklist.}

## Rollback for this stage
{Copy the rollback steps for the current stage.}

## Abort criteria
Stop the entire migration if:
- {condition 1}
- {condition 2}
- {condition 3}
