## Recommended Reading Order

<!-- For new team members or agents encountering this codebase for the first time -->

1. **[Codebase Onboarding](codebase-onboarding.md)** — get the system running locally
2. **[Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md)** — understand the big picture
3. **[Service Map](service-map.md)** — find where code lives
4. **[API Surface](api-surface.md)** — understand the interfaces
5. **[Business Logic](business-logic.md)** — learn the domain rules
6. Browse remaining docs as needed
