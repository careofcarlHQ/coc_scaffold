## Merge Command Contract (solo + copilot)
When asked to merge a PR (for example: "Merga PR#12"), run:
- `./scripts/solo-merge-pr.ps1 -PullNumber <PR_NUMBER>`

Before running merge automation:
- Ensure required CI checks are green
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` exists in environment or `.env.local`

Never push directly to `main`; always use feature branch + PR flow.
