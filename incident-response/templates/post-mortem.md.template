# Post-Mortem — {Incident ID}

## Date: {date}

## Summary

On {date} at {time UTC}, {service} experienced {symptom} for approximately {duration}, affecting {scope — e.g., "all users trying to create orders"}. The root cause was {root cause — one sentence}. The incident was mitigated by {mitigation — e.g., "rolling back to the previous deployment"} at {time} and permanently fixed by {fix — e.g., "adding null check for discount_code field"} deployed at {time}.

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| {HH:MM} | {Change/trigger that caused the incident} |
| {HH:MM} | {First error occurrence} |
| {HH:MM} | {Incident detected — how?} |
| {HH:MM} | {Triage complete — classified as SEVN} |
| {HH:MM} | {Mitigation action taken} |
| {HH:MM} | {User impact resolved} |
| {HH:MM} | {Root cause confirmed} |
| {HH:MM} | {Fix deployed} |
| {HH:MM} | {Incident closed} |

### Key timing

| Metric | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Time to detect | {minutes from start to detection} |
| Time to mitigate | {minutes from detection to user impact resolved} |
| Time to fix | {hours from detection to permanent fix deployed} |
| Total user impact | {minutes/hours of degraded service} |

## Root Cause

### What happened
{Technical description of the root cause.}

### 5 Whys
1. Why? {direct cause}
2. Why? {underlying cause}
3. Why? {deeper cause}
4. Why? {systemic cause}
5. Why? {root cause}

### Contributing factors
- {Factor 1: e.g., "No test coverage for this code path"}
- {Factor 2: e.g., "No post-deploy health check"}
- {Factor 3: e.g., "No monitoring for this error type"}

## Impact

| Dimension | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Duration | {total user-facing impact time} |
| Users affected | {count or percentage} |
| Failed requests | {count, if measurable} |
| Data impact | {none / description} |
| Revenue impact | {estimate / none / unknown} |

## What Went Well

- {e.g., "Error detected within 5 minutes via log monitoring"}
- {e.g., "Rollback executed in under 3 minutes"}
- {e.g., "Incident report was maintained in real time"}

## What Went Poorly

- {e.g., "No test existed for the affected endpoint"}
- {e.g., "Took 15 minutes to identify which deploy to roll back to"}
- {e.g., "No automatic post-deploy health check"}
