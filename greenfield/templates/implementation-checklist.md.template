# Phase {N} Implementation Checklist

Purpose: executable build order with objective acceptance gates.

Scope: {what this phase covers}

Tracking template: `implementation-log.md`

## Exit Definition (Phase {N} Complete)

Phase {N} is complete only when:

1. {Exit criterion 1}
2. {Exit criterion 2}
3. {Exit criterion 3}
4. All acceptance gates below are met

---

## Stage 0 — Foundation Lock

- [ ] Confirm stack and contracts from specs
- [ ] Confirm operational policies
- [ ] No unresolved architectural decisions

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] All team members aligned on approach
- [ ] All referenced spec documents exist

## Stage 1 — Project Skeleton

- [ ] Create folder structure per architecture spec
- [ ] Add dependency management and runtime config
- [ ] Add health endpoint

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] Process starts locally and health check returns ok

## Stage 2 — Core Data Layer

- [ ] Implement schema from data model spec
- [ ] Create baseline migration
- [ ] Add constraints, indexes, and validation

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] Fresh DB bootstrap + migration succeeds from zero
- [ ] Invalid data is rejected

## Stage 3 — Primary API

- [ ] Implement main resource CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Implement state transitions (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement audit logging

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] Can create resources and operate on them via API
- [ ] Invalid operations return appropriate errors

## Stage 4 — Supporting Features

- [ ] Implement secondary endpoints
- [ ] Implement cross-resource business rules
- [ ] Implement error handling for edge cases

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] Supporting features enforce their constraints
- [ ] Error cases handled and tested

## Stage 5 — Background Processing

- [ ] Implement job/task queue (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement worker/processor
- [ ] Implement retry and failure handling

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] Background jobs execute reliably
- [ ] Failures handled per policy

## Stage 6 — Business Rules and Policy

- [ ] Implement domain-specific validation rules
- [ ] Implement access control or authorization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting or cost controls (if applicable)

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] Policy violations are caught and blocked at runtime

## Stage 7 — Output and Reporting

- [ ] Implement output generation (reports, exports, evidence)
- [ ] Implement notification or integration hooks

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] System produces expected outputs for completed work

## Stage 8 — Operational Reliability

- [ ] Validate local development setup
- [ ] Validate startup/shutdown behavior
- [ ] Validate recovery from crashes

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] System restarts cleanly without data corruption

## Stage 9 — Pilot Trial

Run real work through the system:

- [ ] Task A: {low complexity}
- [ ] Task B: {medium complexity}
- [ ] Task C: {higher complexity with edge cases}

Acceptance gate:

- [ ] All tasks complete with expected results
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly

## Stage 10 — Phase Sign-Off

- [ ] Metrics captured
- [ ] Remaining gaps documented for next phase
- [ ] Process improvements identified

Final sign-off criteria:

- [ ] System runs end-to-end without ad-hoc decisions
- [ ] All acceptance gates above are met
- [ ] Ready to begin Phase {N+1} or operate in production
