# Decision Record — {Spike Name}

## Date: {date}
## Decision: {Go / No-go / Pivot / Expand}

---

## Summary
{One paragraph: what was explored, what was decided, and why.}

---

## Criteria Evaluation

| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|---------|
| {Success criterion 1 from charter} | Yes / No / Partial | {reference from findings} |
| {Success criterion 2} | Yes / No / Partial | {reference} |
| {Success criterion 3} | Yes / No / Partial | {reference} |

---

## Rationale
{2-3 sentences: why this decision, given the evidence.}

## Conditions for Revisiting
This decision should be revisited if:
- {Condition 1: e.g., "The library releases v2 with the missing feature"}
- {Condition 2: e.g., "Our traffic grows beyond X requests/sec"}
- {Condition 3: e.g., "The current approach becomes unmaintainable"}

## Next Actions

### If Go:
- [ ] Use {scaffold name} scaffold to implement
- [ ] Scope: {what the first implementation phase covers}
- [ ] Timeline: {when to start}
- [ ] Reference: `spikes/{name}/findings.md` for effort estimate

### If No-go:
- [ ] Archive findings at `spikes/{name}/`
- [ ] Alternative approach: {what to do instead}
- [ ] Communicate decision: {who needs to know}

### If Pivot:
- [ ] New spike question: {refined question}
- [ ] What changed: {what we learned that changes the question}
- [ ] New charter: {link or instructions}

### If Expand:
- [ ] Follow-up spike question: {more focused question}
- [ ] What's known: {what this spike established}
- [ ] What's unknown: {what the follow-up needs to answer}
- [ ] Additional time needed: {estimate}
