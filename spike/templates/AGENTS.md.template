## Success criteria

- {Criterion 2}
- {Criterion 3}

## Read these files
1. `AGENTS.md` (project-level rules)
2. `temp/spike-{name}/charter.md` (what we're exploring)

## Spike rules (different from normal!)
- You MAY hardcode values
- You MAY skip error handling
- You MAY skip tests
- You MAY copy-paste from examples
- You MAY write ugly code — speed over quality

But:
- You MUST work in `temp/spike-{name}/` (not in the main codebase)
- You MUST log everything in the exploration log
- You MUST stay on the charter question
- You MUST NOT install packages in the main project
- You MUST NOT modify existing source code

## Current phase
