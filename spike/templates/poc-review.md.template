## Prototype Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | `temp/spike-{name}/` |
| Language/framework | {what was used} |
| Lines of code | ~{estimate} |
| Dependencies added | {list} |
| Runnable? | {yes — how / no — why} |

---

## What the prototype demonstrates

- {Capability 1: what it proves works}
- {Capability 2}
- {Capability 3}

## What the prototype does NOT demonstrate

- {Limitation 1: e.g., "No error handling — will crash on bad input"}
- {Limitation 2: e.g., "Hardcoded credentials — not suitable for production"}
- {Limitation 3: e.g., "Only tested with small dataset"}

## Code Quality Assessment

This is *spike code* — quality is not the goal. But assess what would need to change for production:

| Aspect | Spike state | Production requirement | Effort |
|--------|------------|----------------------|--------|
| Tests | None | Full coverage | {hours} |
| Error handling | None | Comprehensive | {hours} |
| Configuration | Hardcoded | Environment-based | {hours} |
| Security | Minimal | Full (auth, input validation) | {hours} |
| Logging | Print statements | Structured logging | {hours} |
| Documentation | None | API docs, README | {hours} |

## Reusable Patterns

What from the prototype is worth keeping as a reference?

- [ ] {Pattern 1: e.g., "The Redis connection setup pattern"}
- [ ] {Pattern 2: e.g., "The pagination approach"}
- [ ] Nothing — rebuild from scratch

---

## Recommendation

- [ ] **Archive prototype as reference** — useful patterns for implementation
- [ ] **Discard prototype** — implementation will differ too much
- [ ] **Extract specific components** — {which ones} are worth preserving
