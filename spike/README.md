# Spike Scaffold

> *"Should we build this, and how?"*

The **spike** scaffold is a structured methodology for time-boxed technical exploration. It is the **discovery** companion — designed to answer questions, reduce uncertainty, and produce a clear decision before committing to implementation.

---

## When to use this scaffold

- You're considering a new technology, library, or approach
- You need to answer "is this feasible?" before committing
- You're choosing between multiple technical approaches
- You need to estimate effort for something you've never done before
- You want to prototype an idea without risk to the main codebase
- You're investigating whether an integration is possible

## Core lifecycle

| Phase | Question answered | Key output |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **Charter** | What are we trying to learn? | Spike charter with time box |
| **Exploration** | What do we discover? | Exploration log with findings |
| **Prototype** | Does it actually work? | Working proof of concept |
| **Findings** | What did we learn? | Documented findings |
| **Decision** | What do we do next? | Go / no-go / pivot decision |
| **Cleanup** | What do we keep? | Archived artifacts, reusable knowledge |
