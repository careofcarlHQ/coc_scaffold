# Regression Test Plan — {Bug Title}

## Date: {date}
## Bug reference: `bugfix/root-cause-analysis.md`

---

## Primary Regression Test

### Purpose
Prevent the exact bug from recurring.

### Test case
```python
def test_{descriptive_name}():
    """Regression: {brief description of bug}.
    
    Root cause: {one sentence root cause}.
    Fix: {one sentence fix description}.
    See: bugfix/root-cause-analysis.md
    """
    # Setup: {create conditions that trigger the bug}
    
    # Action: {trigger the code path}
    
    # Assert: {verify correct behavior}
```

### Verification
- [ ] Test FAILS before the fix is applied
- [ ] Test PASSES after the fix is applied
- [ ] Test is independent of other tests
- [ ] Test has descriptive name and docstring

---

## Sibling Regression Tests

### Purpose
Prevent the same class of bug in related code paths.

| Test | Protects | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| `test_{sibling_1}` | {code path} | {P0/P1} |
| `test_{sibling_2}` | {code path} | {P0/P1} |

---

## Broader Prevention Tests

### Purpose
Strengthen coverage beyond the immediate bug.

| Test category | Description | Priority | Status |
|---------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| {Category} | {What it tests} | {P0/P1/P2} | {written / to-do / deferred} |

---

## Test Results

### Before fix
```
{test output showing failure}
```

### After fix
```
{test output showing pass}
```

### Full suite after fix
```
{summary: N passed, 0 failed, S skipped}
```
